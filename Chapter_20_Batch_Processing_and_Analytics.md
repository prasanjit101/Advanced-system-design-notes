# Chapter 20: Batch Processing & Analytics

## Introduction

Batch processing involves collecting and processing large volumes of data in groups or batches, typically during scheduled intervals. This approach is fundamental for data analytics, reporting, and large-scale data transformations. Understanding batch processing concepts and architectures is essential for building systems that can handle complex analytical workloads efficiently.

## MapReduce Framework

MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets across distributed clusters. It simplifies parallel computing by abstracting the complexity of distributed processing.

### Core Concepts

#### Map Phase
- **Input**: Key-value pairs fed to map function
- **Processing**: Map function transforms input to intermediate key-value pairs
- **Output**: Intermediate key-value pairs grouped by key

#### Shuffle and Sort Phase
- **Partitioning**: Distribute data to reducers based on keys
- **Sorting**: Sort values by key before reducing
- **Grouping**: Group values with the same key

#### Reduce Phase
- **Input**: Key with associated list of values
- **Processing**: Reduce function aggregates values for each key
- **Output**: Final key-value pairs written to storage

### MapReduce Workflow
```
Input Data → Split → Map → Shuffle/Sort → Reduce → Output
```

### Example: Word Count
```python
# Map function
def map(doc_id, document):
    for word in document.split():
        emit(word, 1)

# Reduce function
def reduce(word, counts):
    emit(word, sum(counts))
```

### Real-world Example
Google uses MapReduce to process web crawl data, analyzing billions of web pages to build search indexes and compute page rankings.

### Advantages
- **Scalability**: Process petabytes of data across thousands of machines
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic handling of node failures
- **Abstraction**: Simplifies distributed programming
- **Cost Efficiency**: Runs on commodity hardware

### Limitations
- **Latency**: Higher latency compared to stream processing

## OLAP vs OLTP

Understanding the differences between Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) is crucial for designing appropriate data systems.

### OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
- **Purpose**: Support day-to-day operational needs
- **Operations**: Many short, fast transactions
- **Database Design**: Normalized schemas (3NF)
- **Read/Write Ratio**: Balanced or write-heavy
- **Response Time**: Milliseconds
- **Data Volume**: Small data sets per query
- **User Type**: End users and operational staff

### OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- **Purpose**: Support business intelligence and analytics
- **Operations**: Complex analytical queries
- **Database Design**: Denormalized schemas (star/snowflake)
- **Read/Write Ratio**: Read-heavy
- **Response Time**: Seconds to minutes
- **Data Volume**: Large data sets per query
- **User Type**: Analysts, executives, data scientists

### Comparison Table
| Aspect | OLTP | OLAP |
|--------|------|------|
| Primary Purpose | Operational Efficiency | Analytical Insight |
| Data Source | Current, real-time | Historical, aggregated |
| Data Operations | Insert, Update, Delete | Complex Queries |
| Database Schema | Normalized | Denormalized |
| Backup Strategy | Critical, frequent | Less critical |

### Real-world Example
An e-commerce platform uses OLTP for order processing (adding items to carts, processing payments) and OLAP for analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory optimization.

## Materialized Views

Materialized views are database objects that store the result of a query physically, significantly improving query performance for complex analytical operations.

### Benefits
- **Performance**: Pre-computed results eliminate expensive computations
- **Query Simplification**: Complex logic encapsulated in view
- **Consistency**: Same query logic across applications
- **Caching**: Frequent query results readily available

### Refresh Strategies
1. **Complete Refresh**: Recompute entire view
2. **Incremental Refresh**: Update only changed data
3. **Fast Refresh**: Optimize based on change tracking
4. **On-Demand**: Refresh when triggered

### Design Considerations
- **Storage Overhead**: Additional storage for view data
- **Maintenance Cost**: Resource requirements for refresh operations
- **Freshness Requirements**: Balance between performance and data currency
- **Update Patterns**: Align refresh schedule with data changes

### Use Cases
- **Aggregations**: Pre-computed summaries and statistics
- **Joins**: Complex multi-table joins
- **Calculations**: Expensive mathematical operations
- **Reporting**: Standardized business metrics

### Real-world Example
A financial services company maintains materialized views of daily trading summaries to enable fast reporting dashboards that would otherwise require expensive real-time aggregations across multiple tables.

## Design of Analytics-Friendly Schemas

Creating schemas optimized for analytical queries is crucial for performance in data warehousing and analytics systems.

### Dimensional Modeling
- **Facts**: Numeric, measurable data (sales amounts, quantities)
- **Dimensions**: Contextual data (time, product, geography)
- **Star Schema**: Fact table connected to dimension tables
- **Snowflake Schema**: Normalized dimension tables

### Star Schema Example
```
Fact_Sales
├── sale_id
├── product_id → Dim_Product
├── customer_id → Dim_Customer
├── date_id → Dim_Date
├── store_id → Dim_Store
└── sales_amount
```

### Schema Design Principles
1. **Denormalization**: Reduce join complexity
2. **Surrogate Keys**: Use artificial keys for dimensions
3. **Slowly Changing Dimensions**: Handle dimension changes over time
4. **Hierarchy Flattening**: Pre-compute hierarchies in dimensions
