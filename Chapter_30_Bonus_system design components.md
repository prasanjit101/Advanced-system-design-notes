# System Design Components

This document covers key system design components that are fundamental to building scalable, reliable, and efficient distributed systems.

## Stateful Workflow Engine

A stateful workflow engine is a component that manages and executes business processes or workflows that maintain state across multiple steps or operations. Unlike stateless systems, these engines track the progress and current state of ongoing processes.

### Key Features:
- **State Persistence**: Maintains the state of workflows across system restarts
- **Execution Management**: Coordinates the execution of multiple steps in a defined sequence
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms for retry, rollback, or compensation in case of failures
- **Scalability**: Often designed to handle high volume of concurrent workflows
- **Visibility**: Provides monitoring and debugging capabilities for ongoing processes

### Common Use Cases:
- Order processing systems
- Payment processing workflows
- Multi-step user onboarding processes
- Data pipeline orchestration
- Business process automation

### Popular Implementations:
- AWS Step Functions
- Temporal
- Apache Airflow
- Conductor by Netflix
- Cadence

## Queues

Queues are fundamental components used to decouple system components, manage load distribution, and ensure reliable message delivery between services.

### Types of Queues:

#### 1. Message Queues
- Used for asynchronous communication between services
- Enable load leveling and fault tolerance
- Examples: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS

#### 2. Priority Queues
- Allow messages to be processed based on priority levels
- Useful for time-sensitive operations or customer tier differentiation

#### 3. Dead Letter Queues
- Store messages that cannot be processed after several attempts
- Aid in debugging and error handling

### Key Characteristics:
- **Decoupling**: Allow services to operate independently
- **Scalability**: Enable horizontal scaling of processing capacity
- **Reliability**: Provide durability and fault tolerance
- **Buffering**: Smooth out load spikes and processing imbalances

### Common Queue Patterns:
- **Fan-out**: One-to-many message distribution
- **Point-to-point**: Direct communication between sender and receiver
- **Publish-subscribe**: Multiple subscribers receive copies of messages
- **Request-response**: Synchronous communication over a queue

## Caching Systems

Caching components store frequently accessed data in fast storage to reduce latency and improve system performance.

### Types:
- **In-memory caches**: Redis, Memcached
- **CDN caches**: CloudFlare, Akamai
- **Database caches**: Query result caching

## Event Stores

Components that store events as a log of changes, enabling event sourcing and temporal queries.

## Message Brokers

Middleware that enables applications to communicate and exchange information through messages.

### Examples:
- Apache Kafka
- RabbitMQ

### CAP Theorem and Related Concepts
The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of the following three properties simultaneously:

#### Consistency
All nodes in the system see the same data at the same time.

#### Availability
The system continues to operate and respond to requests.

#### Partition Tolerance
The system continues to operate despite network failures that prevent some nodes from communicating with others.

#### PACELC Theorem
An extension of the CAP theorem stating that if there's a partition (P), you must choose availability (A) or consistency (C), but else (E), if there's no partition, you must choose latency (L) or consistency (C).
