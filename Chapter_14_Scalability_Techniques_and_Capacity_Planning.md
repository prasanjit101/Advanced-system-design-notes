# Chapter 14: Scalability Techniques & Capacity Planning

## Introduction

Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. It's a critical aspect of system design that determines how well a system can adapt to increased demand. Capacity planning is the process of determining the production capacity needed by an organization to meet changing demands for its products. Together, these concepts ensure that systems can grow efficiently while maintaining performance and cost-effectiveness.

## Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

### Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)

Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of existing resources by adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server or node.

**Advantages:**
- Simpler to implement
- No changes needed to application logic
- Shared data between CPU cores
- No network overhead between components

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited by hardware constraints
- Single point of failure
- Expensive high-end hardware
- Downtime required for upgrades

**Real-World Example: Database Server Upgrade**
- Current server: 8 CPU cores, 32GB RAM
- Upgrade to: 16 CPU cores, 128GB RAM
- Same database instance, better performance
- Application code unchanged

### Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)

Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers or nodes to distribute the load across multiple machines.

**Advantages:**
- Near-unlimited scalability
- Better fault tolerance
- Cost-effective (commodity hardware)
- Can be done without downtime

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex application architecture
- Data consistency challenges
- Network overhead
- Distributed system complexity

**Real-World Example: Web Application Auto-Scaling**
- Start with 3 application servers
- Add 2 more servers during high traffic
- Remove extra servers during low traffic
- Load balancer distributes requests among all servers

**Mermaid Diagram: Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Vertical Scaling"
        A[Single Server] --> B[More CPU]
        A --> C[More RAM]
        A --> D[More Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Horizontal Scaling"
        E[Server 1] --> H[Load Balancer]
        F[Server 2] --> H
        G[Server N] --> H
    end
```

### Choosing Between Vertical and Horizontal Scaling

**Choose Vertical Scaling When:**
- Application doesn't support distribution
- Workload is CPU-intensive but requires shared memory
- Limited budget for distributed system complexity
- Predictable, moderate growth

**Choose Horizontal Scaling When:**
- High availability is crucial
- Growth is unpredictable or very high
- Application is stateless
- Need geographic distribution

## Partitioning Strategies

### Vertical Partitioning

Vertical partitioning divides a database table by columns, storing different columns in different tables or databases.

**Approach:**
- Separate frequently accessed columns from rarely accessed ones
- Store different entity types in separate databases
- Often results in normalized schemas

**Example:**
```
Original User Table:
{id, name, email, password, profile_image, last_login, preferences}

Vertical Partitioning:
User Core: {id, name, email, password, last_login}
User Profile: {id, profile_image, preferences}
```

### Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)

Horizontal partitioning splits a table by rows, distributing them across multiple databases or servers.

**Sharding Strategies:**

**Range-Based Sharding:**
- Partition based on ranges of values
- Example: Users with IDs 1-1000000 in Shard A, 1000001-2000000 in Shard B

**Hash-Based Sharding:**
- Use hash function on shard key to determine partition
- Provides better distribution
- Difficult to add/remove shards

**Directory-Based Sharding:**
- Use a lookup table to map keys to shards
- Most flexible but adds complexity

**Mermaid Diagram: Hash-Based Sharding**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application Request] --> B{Hash User ID}
    B --> C[User 12345]
    C --> D[Hash Function]
    D --> E[Shard 2]
    B --> F[User 67890]
    F --> D
    D --> G[Shard 1]
    B --> H[User 54321]
    H --> D
    D --> I[Shard 3]
    
    E --> J[Database Shard 2]
    G --> K[Database Shard 1]
    I --> L[Database Shard 3]
```

### Partitioning Considerations

**Shard Key Selection:**
- Should distribute data evenly
- Should align with common query patterns
- Should minimize cross-shard operations

**Cross-Shard Operations:**
- Joins across shards are complex
- Transactions spanning shards require distributed handling
- May require application-level logic

## Autoscaling Policies

### CPU-Based Autoscaling

Scale based on CPU utilization metrics.

**Implementation:**
- Set target CPU utilization (e.g., 70%)
- Add servers when CPU exceeds threshold
- Remove servers when CPU falls below threshold

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement and understand
- Direct correlation with processing capacity

**Cons:**
- May not reflect actual user experience
- Doesn't account for I/O-bound workloads

### Request-Based Autoscaling

Scale based on request rate or queue length.

**Implementation:**
- Set target requests per second per server
- Add servers when request rate exceeds capacity
- Remove servers when demand decreases

**Pros:**
- More directly related to user demand
- Works well for web applications

**Cons:**
- May not account for request complexity
- Requires monitoring infrastructure

### Custom Metrics Autoscaling

Scale based on application-specific metrics.

**Examples:**
- Queue length for message processing systems
- Database connection pool usage
- Business metrics like active users

**Mermaid Diagram: Auto-scaling Architecture**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Load Metrics] --> B{Threshold Check}
    B -->|High Load| C[Scale Up]
    B -->|Low Load| D[Scale Down]
    B -->|Normal Load| E[No Change]
    C --> F[Add Resources]
    D --> G[Remove Resources]
    F --> H[Monitor Performance]
    G --> H
    H --> A
```

### Predictive Autoscaling

Use historical data and machine learning to predict traffic patterns.

**Approaches:**
- Time-based scaling (anticipate daily/weekly patterns)
- ML-based prediction (analyze multiple factors)
- Hybrid approaches combining prediction and real-time metrics

**Black Friday Planning Process:**
1. Historical Analysis: Review past Black Friday traffic
2. Growth Projection: Account for year-over-year growth
3. Headroom Calculation: Plan for 2x-3x normal traffic
4. Resource Procurement: Reserve additional capacity
5. Testing: Simulate Black Friday traffic in advance
6. Monitoring: Real-time capacity and performance monitoring

## Headroom Planning

### What is Headroom?

Headroom is the extra capacity reserved beyond expected demand to handle unexpected spikes, traffic surges, or component failures.

### Types of Headroom

**Performance Headroom:**
- Extra capacity to maintain performance during unexpected load
- Typically 20-30% above expected peak usage
- Ensures consistent user experience

**Failure Headroom:**
- Capacity to maintain service during component failures
- Allows for graceful degradation
- Critical for high-availability systems

**Growth Headroom:**
- Capacity for unanticipated growth
- Buffer against inaccurate projections
- Flexibility for business opportunities

### Headroom Calculation

**Rule of Thumb Approach:**
- Normal: 20-30% headroom
- Critical systems: 40-50% headroom
- Seasonal businesses: Variable headroom based on patterns

**Mathematical Approach:**
```
Required Capacity = Expected Peak Load + (Expected Peak Load × Headroom Percentage)
Example: 10,000 requests/sec × (1 + 0.30) = 13,000 requests/sec
```

### Cost vs. Performance Trade-offs

**High Headroom:**
- Pros: Better performance during spikes, higher availability
- Cons: Higher infrastructure costs, lower resource utilization

**Low Headroom:**
- Pros: Lower costs, higher resource utilization
- Cons: Performance degradation during spikes, higher risk of outages

## Summary

Effective scalability and capacity planning require understanding your current system's limitations and projecting future needs. Choose the right scaling approach (vertical vs. horizontal) based on your specific requirements. Implement proper partitioning strategies to distribute load effectively. Set up intelligent autoscaling policies that respond to actual demand. Plan for capacity with appropriate headroom to handle unexpected spikes. Regularly monitor, test, and optimize your system to maintain performance as it scales. Remember that scalability is an ongoing process rather than a one-time implementation, requiring continuous attention and adjustment as your system and user base grow.
